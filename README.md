# Social Media User Management App

A user management system for a social media platform, allowing users to register, authenticate, follow/unfollow other users, and reset passwords (work-in-progress). This application provides functionalities to manage user accounts, relationships, and password security in a secure and scalable manner.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Allow users to register with their email and username.
- **User Authentication**: Users can log in using their credentials, with secure password hashing.
- **Follow/Unfollow Users**: Users can follow or unfollow other users.
- **Password Reset**: Users can request a password reset through email and change their password.
- **Profile Management**: Users can update their profile information.
- **Secure & Scalable**: Implements secure password hashing, token-based authentication, and scalable architecture.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core**: Web API framework for building RESTful services.
- **Entity Framework Core**: ORM for database access.
- **SQL Server**: Database to store user and follow data.
- **JWT Authentication**: For securing user login and API calls.
- **SMTP/Email Service**: For sending password reset emails. (Incomplete)
- **AutoMapper**: For object-to-object mapping, simplifying code.

## API Endpoints

### 1. **User Registration**
`POST /auth/register`  
- Registers a new user with email, username, and password.

### 4. **Refresh JWT Token**
`POST /auth/refresh-token`  
- Refreshes the JWT token if expired or near expiration.

### 5. **Get User Profile**
`GET /users/{userId}`  
- Retrieves a user's profile information.

### 7. **Delete User Account**
`DELETE /users/{userId}`  
- Deletes a userâ€™s account.

### 8. **Follow User**

- Allows a user to follow another user by their user ID.

### 9. **Unfollow User**

- Allows a user to unfollow another user.

### 10. **Get User's Followers**
`GET /users/{userId}/followers`  
- Retrieves the list of followers of a user.

### 11. **Get Users Following**

- Searches for users based on a query (e.g., by username, name).  
  **Query Params**:
  - `query`: The search term.
  - `limit`: Number of results to return.


## Database Design

The database schema consists of the following tables:

- **Users**: Stores user details such as email, username, and password hash.
- **UserFollows**: Stores the follow relationships between users.
- **Sessions**: Stores the sessions of users. (Incomplete)

## Prerequisites
